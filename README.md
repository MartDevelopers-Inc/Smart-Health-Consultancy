# Smart Health Consultancy
It might have happened so many times that you or someone yours
need doctors help immediately, but they are not available due to some
reason. The Smart Health Consultation application is an end user
support and online consultation project. Here we propose an android

application that allows users to get instant guidance on their health is-
sues through an android health care application online.The application

allows user to share their symptoms and issues with a doctor of their
choice depending on the nature of the ailment. The doctor then checks

the userâ€™s symptoms to check for various illness that could be associ-
ated with it. Then the doctor advices the patient on what medicine

to take or if they need to go for further testing . The patient can then
share the test results with doctor and from there the doctor advices
them on the right medication to take for their ailments.
