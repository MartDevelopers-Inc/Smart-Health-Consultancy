# Motive Behind Smart Health
```
It might have happened so many times that you or someone yours
need doctors help immediately, but they are not available due to some
reason. The Smart Health Consultation application is an end user
support and online consultation project. This  android application
allows users to get instant guidance on their health issues.
The application allows user to share their symptoms and issues with 
a doctor of their choice depending on the nature of the ailment. 
The doctor then checks  the userâ€™s symptoms to check for various
illness that could be associated with it.
Then the doctor advices the patient on what medicine
to take or if they need to go for further testing.
